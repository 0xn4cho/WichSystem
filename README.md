# WHSYSTEM

**WHSYSTEM** is a Python tool that identifies the operating system of a remote IP address based on the TTL (Time To Live) value obtained from a ping.

## Features

- **Operating System Detection:** Sends a ping to the provided IP address and analyzes the TTL value of the response to determine the remote host's operating system.
  - **TTL 0-64:** Typically indicates a Linux-based system.
  - **TTL 65-128:** Typically indicates a Windows-based system.
  - **TTL outside these ranges:** Indicates that the operating system could not be determined.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `WichSystem.py` file.
2. Run the script from the command line, providing the target IP address:
   ```sh
   python WichSystem.py <ip-address>

## Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. Modules re, sys, subprocess, and art (for logo visualization).

## Example 
```sh
python WichSystem.py 192.168.10.1
```
